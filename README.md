# This is a project of code similarity detection 
![project for](https://img.shields.io/badge/test-success-brightgreen.svg)

![current](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0-blue.svg)

- Based on the idea behind [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/): Measure Of Software Similarity
- Also refered to the project [Nicad](https://www.txl.ca/nicaddownload.html)
- Refer to the paper [sigmoid3](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigmod03.pdf) and paper [similarity](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring13/cos598C/broder97resemblance.pdf) and paper [simhash](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci572/papers/DetectingDuplicates.pdf)
- Similar to Stanford University's MOSS plagiarsm detection, [see here](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/).
- Try to build an variational autoencoder (VAE) to compress the information of codes with the Neural Network based on Keras and tensorflow, although worked,  the result is not satisfied. :)
